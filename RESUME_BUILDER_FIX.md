# 🔧 Resume Builder - Error Fixed

## ✅ Problem Identified and Solved

### **The Issue:**
The Resume model required `fileUrl`, `fileType`, and `fileSize` fields to be filled, but the Resume Builder form wasn't uploading actual files - it was just creating resume data from form inputs.

### **The Solution:**
✨ Made these fields **optional** in the backend Resume model with sensible defaults:
- `fileUrl`: defaults to `''` (empty string)
- `fileType`: defaults to `'json'` (since we're storing structured data)
- `fileSize`: defaults to `0`

---

## 🚀 How to Apply the Fix

### Step 1: Restart Backend Server
The Resume model has been updated, so you need to restart the backend:

1. Go to the **Backend terminal**
2. Press **Ctrl+C** to stop the server
3. Run: `npm start`
4. Wait for "Server running on port 5000" message

### Step 2: Test Resume Creation

#### Option A: Use the Main Application
1. Open http://localhost:5173
2. Login with user credentials: `user@user.com` / `user123`
3. Click **"Resume Builder"** tab
4. Click **"+ Create New Resume"** button
5. Fill in the form:
   - **Resume Name**: "My Software Engineer Resume"
   - **Personal Info**: Name, Email, Phone, Location
   - **Summary**: Brief professional summary
   - **Skills**: Add skills separated by commas
6. Click **"Create Resume"**
7. You should see success message!

#### Option B: Use the Test Page
1. Open `resume-builder-test.html` in your browser
2. Click **"🔐 Login"** (credentials pre-filled)
3. Click **"✨ Create Resume"** (form pre-filled with sample data)
4. Check the result - should show success with Resume ID

  enum: ['pdf', 'doc', 'docx'],
  required: true  // ❌ Required but not provided
},
fileSize: {
  type: Number,

fileUrl: {
  type: String,
  required: false,  // ✅ Optional now
  default: ''
},
fileType: {

  required: false,
  default: 'json'
