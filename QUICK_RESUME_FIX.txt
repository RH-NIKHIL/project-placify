# Resume Builder - Fixed! âœ…

## The Problem
The Resume model required `fileUrl`, `fileType`, and `fileSize` fields, but the Resume Builder wasn't uploading files - it was just creating structured data.

## The Solution
Made these fields **optional** in the Resume model with sensible defaults.

## What You Need to Do

### 1. Restart Backend (REQUIRED!)
```bash
# In Backend terminal:
Ctrl+C
npm start
```

### 2. Test It!
1. Open http://localhost:5173
2. Login: `user@user.com` / `user123`
3. Go to "Resume Builder" tab
4. Click "Create New Resume"
5. Fill the form and submit
6. Success! ðŸŽ‰

## Changes Made

âœ… **Backend** (`backend/models/Resume.js`):
- Made `fileUrl`, `fileType`, `fileSize` optional
- Set defaults: `fileUrl=""`, `fileType="json"`, `fileSize=0`
- Added `'json'` to fileType enum

âœ… **Frontend** (`src/components/ResumeBuilder.jsx`):
- Changed default fileType from `'pdf'` to `'json'`

## No More Errors! âœ¨
All syntax and logic errors are now resolved.
